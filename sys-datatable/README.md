## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a challenging project for me. It was the first time I'd build a landing page. The project took longer than I expected it to, and I think the most important lesson this has taught me is to plan. Plan the layout of the project; identify components that look similar, assign them like classes to reduce extra work in css. I spent so much time on cssðŸ’€.

It was worth it though, I was able to grasp certain concepts better. For example, the difference between child and descendant selectors; grid-auto-flow; manipulating bg images; transition and its limitations. For JS, I think I understand hoisting and closures a bit better now. For HTML, I tried to use semantic tags and set alt attribute of placeholder img tags to role=presentation


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<img class="thumbnails" src="./images/image-plane.jpg" alt="role=presentation">
```
```css
table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
}

.social-logo > img:hover {
    filter: invert(68%) sepia(92%) saturate(425%) hue-rotate(75deg) brightness(89%) contrast(85%);
    cursor: pointer;
}

.footer-nav-list {
    grid-column: 4 / span 4;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 0.5fr);
    grid-auto-flow: column;
    column-gap: 1em;
}
```
```js
// STUB: map elems in clientInfoListValues to input values in edit modal form
editModalFormInpList.map((inputElem, index) => {
    inputElem.value = clientInfoListValues[index]
})
```

### Continued development

I still need more practice using grids, but I've come to appreciate the full control it gives me in layout.

I also need more practice with JS hoisting and closures. I think there are certain use cases that I need to understand.

### Useful resources

- [:nth-of-type() selector | resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) - This helped me understand how to use css selectors to match elements. We can use odd/even in the param, and it'll select the odd/even numbered element in a list. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [:nth-child selector | resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) - This helped me understand the type of parameters that can be passed in the :nth-of-type() selector. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [color-name | resource 3](https://www.color-name.com/) - This helps us with color names. We can search color names by hex code.
- [Use dialog for the easiest way to make a popup modal | resource 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAB_v6yBXIE) - This helped me understand how dialog boxes can be used as modals. I really liked this pattern because it's an easier (and semantically efficient) way of creating modals. I will definitely use the pattern going forward.
- [In Defence of Dialog | resource 5](https://whistlr.info/2021/in-defence-of-dialog/) - This helped with examples and usecases of the dialog html element, and also how to enable/disable scrolling in the backdrop
- [<dialog>: The Dialog element | resource 6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) - This is the documentation for the dialog html element.
- [aria-hidden | resource 7](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-hidden) - This is the documentation for the aria-hidden attribute. It helped me understand how to hide redundant/non-interactive content from the accessibility API. We can use it to improve accessibility.
- [Bootstrap : CRUD Table | resource 8](https://codepen.io/zic72/pen/BayvgZo) - This is a codepen containing a CRUD table. It was inspiration for building this project.
- [FormData() method | resource 9](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData) - This is the mdn resource on the FormData() method. I used the formData() method to collect user input from the addClient, deleteClient & editClient modals.
- [Using FormData Objects Effectively | resource 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWJhE7Licjs&t=637s) - This is a formData() tutorial from "Steve Griffith - Prof3ssorSt3v3". I liked how he explained the use case for the formData() method; parsing user input from HTML to JavaScript.
- [Saving User Input in JS Objects | resource 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxVCq4p0Kb0) - This is a html-js tutorial from "Steve Griffith - Prof3ssorSt3v3". I liked how he explained how to add values from a form into an object data structure.
- [Learn JavaScript Event Listeners In 18 Minutes | resource 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF1_MlZ5l6M) - This is a video from "Kyle - Web Dev Simplified" explaining event listeners. I liked the addGlobalEventListener function he used; it helps dynamically add event listeners to elements.
- [Implement toggle for checkbox with JavaScript/jQuery | resource 13](https://www.techiedelight.com/implement-toggle-check-box-javascript/) - This is an article on choosing the right property to target when trying to toggle a checkbox. I liked the method used; I slightly modified it though.
- [Node.removeChild() - MDN | resource 14](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild) - This is an mdn resource on removing childNodes. I copied the example on removing a specified element without having to specify its parent node. I like the style.
- [Hoisting | resource 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting) - This is the mdn documentation for how hoisting works in JavaScript.
- [Grid auto-flow resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Auto-placement_in_CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me flow grid items by column, rather than the defailt row. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [HEX to Filter converter for SVG](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This helped me easily change the color of SVG icons in img tag. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

Big thanks goes to Lamide for her hack on adjusting img height with CSS classes (I didn't think it would work, but it did!ðŸ˜‚). It helped adjust the disparate image heights of .thumbnails. Saved me weeks of headache

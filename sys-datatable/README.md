## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a challenging project for me. It was the first time I'd build a landing page. The project took longer than I expected it to, and I think the most important lesson this has taught me is to plan. Plan the layout of the project; identify components that look similar, assign them like classes to reduce extra work in css. I spent so much time on cssðŸ’€.

It was worth it though, I was able to grasp certain concepts better. For example, the difference between child and descendant selectors; grid-auto-flow; manipulating bg images; transition and its limitations. For JS, I think I understand hoisting and closures a bit better now. For HTML, I tried to use semantic tags and set alt attribute of placeholder img tags to role=presentation


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<img class="thumbnails" src="./images/image-plane.jpg" alt="role=presentation">
```
```css
table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
}

.social-logo > img:hover {
    filter: invert(68%) sepia(92%) saturate(425%) hue-rotate(75deg) brightness(89%) contrast(85%);
    cursor: pointer;
}

.footer-nav-list {
    grid-column: 4 / span 4;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 0.5fr);
    grid-auto-flow: column;
    column-gap: 1em;
}
```
```js
hamburger.addEventListener("click", () => { 
  if (!menuOpen) {
      hamburger.setAttribute("src", "./images/icon-close.svg")
      navList.classList.toggle("show")
      menuOpen = true
  } else {
      hamburger.setAttribute("src", "./images/icon-hamburger.svg")
      navList.classList.toggle("show")
      menuOpen = false
  }
})
```

### Continued development

I still need more practice using grids, but I've come to appreciate the full control it gives me in layout.

I also need more practice with JS hoisting and closures. I think there are certain use cases that I need to understand.

### Useful resources

- [:nth-of-type() selector | resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) - This helped me understand how to use css selectors to match elements. We can use odd/even in the param, and it'll select the odd/even numbered element in a list. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [:nth-child selector | resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) - This helped me understand the type of parameters that can be passed in the :nth-of-type() selector. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [color-name | resource 3](https://www.color-name.com/) - This helps us with color names. We can search by hex code.
- [Hoisting | resource 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting) - This is the mdn documentation for how hoisting works in JavaScript.
- [Grid auto-flow resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Auto-placement_in_CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me flow grid items by column, rather than the defailt row. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [HEX to Filter converter for SVG](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This helped me easily change the color of SVG icons in img tag. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

Big thanks goes to Lamide for her hack on adjusting img height with CSS classes (I didn't think it would work, but it did!ðŸ˜‚). It helped adjust the disparate image heights of .thumbnails. Saved me weeks of headache

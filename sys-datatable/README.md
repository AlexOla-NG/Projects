## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Perform CRUD operations

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a redo of a project I attempted in January this year.

The original project was very plain, there was barely any CSS in it. I remember building it was very stressful because it was the first ever project I worked on.

6 months later (August), a bunch of FCC courses, and Frontend Mentor projects, and I'm really proud of the progress I've made.

I'm glad I took the leap to switch careersðŸ˜„

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<dialog id="addClientModal" class="modal"></dialog>
```

```css
table tbody tr:nth-of-type(odd) {
  background-color: var(--lotion);
}

table input[type="checkbox"] {
  transform: scale(2);
}
```

```js
// STUB: map elems in clientInfoListValues to input values in edit modal form
editModalFormInpList.map((inputElem, index) => {
  inputElem.value = clientInfoListValues[index];
});
```

### Continued development

I still need more practice writing js logic. The search functionality is buggy. The highlighted td should return to default style when searchInp is cleared, however, this is not the case

### Useful resources

- [:nth-of-type() selector | resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) - This helped me understand how to use css selectors to match elements. We can use odd/even in the param, and it'll select the odd/even numbered element in a list. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [:nth-child selector | resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) - This helped me understand the type of parameters that can be passed in the :nth-of-type() selector. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [color-name | resource 3](https://www.color-name.com/) - This helps us with color names. We can search color names by hex code.
- [Use dialog for the easiest way to make a popup modal | resource 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAB_v6yBXIE) - This helped me understand how dialog boxes can be used as modals. I really liked this pattern because it's an easier (and semantically efficient) way of creating modals. I will definitely use the pattern going forward.
- [In Defence of Dialog | resource 5](https://whistlr.info/2021/in-defence-of-dialog/) - This helped with examples and usecases of the dialog html element, and also how to enable/disable scrolling in the backdrop
- [<dialog>: The Dialog element | resource 6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) - This is the documentation for the dialog html element.
- [aria-hidden | resource 7](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-hidden) - This is the documentation for the aria-hidden attribute. It helped me understand how to hide redundant/non-interactive content from the accessibility API. We can use it to improve accessibility.
- [Bootstrap : CRUD Table | resource 8](https://codepen.io/zic72/pen/BayvgZo) - This is a codepen containing a CRUD table. It was inspiration for building this project.
- [FormData() method | resource 9](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData) - This is the mdn resource on the FormData() method. I used the formData() method to collect user input from the addClient, deleteClient & editClient modals.
- [Using FormData Objects Effectively | resource 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWJhE7Licjs&t=637s) - This is a formData() tutorial from "Steve Griffith - Prof3ssorSt3v3". I liked how he explained the use case for the formData() method; parsing user input from HTML to JavaScript.
- [Saving User Input in JS Objects | resource 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxVCq4p0Kb0) - This is a html-js tutorial from "Steve Griffith - Prof3ssorSt3v3". I liked how he explained how to add values from a form into an object data structure.
- [Learn JavaScript Event Listeners In 18 Minutes | resource 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF1_MlZ5l6M) - This is a video from "Kyle - Web Dev Simplified" explaining event listeners. I liked the addGlobalEventListener function he used; it helps dynamically add event listeners to elements.
- [Implement toggle for checkbox with JavaScript/jQuery | resource 13](https://www.techiedelight.com/implement-toggle-check-box-javascript/) - This is an article on choosing the right property to target when trying to toggle a checkbox. I liked the method used; I slightly modified it though.
- [Node.removeChild() - MDN | resource 14](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild) - This is an mdn resource on removing childNodes. I copied the example on removing a specified element without having to specify its parent node. I like the style.

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to the html & css course on FreeCodeCamp. Without this course, my knowledge of CSS would have not improved the way it has.
Special shoutout also goes to Kevin Powell; watching him deconstruct CSS on his youtube channel made CSS easier to understand and work with.
